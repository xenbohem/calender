You've just stumbled upon a calendar created by Xen in collaboration with Blackbox ai. 
It's calendar time! Isn't it always? 
No matter where I am, I'm always looking for one, it's like a quantum map if you will.
A map of conclusive time or epic plans far off into the ether-realm of the imaginational bliss.
ANYWAY.
Copy the code and make your own.
You will need to create a github account and a repository.
Don't forget to name it: Calendar. :-P *duh*
Tah tah for now.
Xen
